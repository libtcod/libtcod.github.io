# Distributing Python programs with PyInstaller

You can start making distributions of your game from the moment it runs.
There are multiple tools to do this with, but this example will use [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/).

This assumes you have a project started with a `main.py` script, and that all your data assets are in a directory called `data`.

First you need to install [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) using pip.
You can do this with the command: `pip install pyinstaller`

`/build.spec` is the result of modifying a `.spec` file automatically generated by PyInstaller.

```python
# -*- mode: python ; coding: utf-8 -*-
# https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io/en/stable/spec-files.html
block_cipher = None
PROJECT_NAME = "roguelike_tutorial"

a = Analysis(
    ["main.py"],
    binaries=[],
    datas=[("data", "data")],  # Include all files in the 'data' directory.
    hiddenimports=[],
    hookspath=[],
    runtime_hooks=[],
    excludes=[],
    win_no_prefer_redirects=False,
    win_private_assemblies=False,
    cipher=block_cipher,
    noarchive=False,
)
pyz = PYZ(a.pure, a.zipped_data, cipher=block_cipher)
exe = EXE(
    pyz,
    a.scripts,
    [],
    exclude_binaries=True,
    name=PROJECT_NAME,  # Name of the executable.
    debug=False,
    bootloader_ignore_signals=False,
    strip=False,
    upx=True,
    console=True,  # Set to False to disable the Windows terminal.
    icon="icon.ico",  # Windows icon file.
)
coll = COLLECT(
    exe,
    a.binaries,
    a.zipfiles,
    a.datas,
    strip=False,
    upx=True,
    upx_exclude=[],
    name=PROJECT_NAME,  # Name of the distribution directory.
)
```

`pathex` has been removed to make this configuration portable.
You can build a project using this `spec` file with the command `pyinstaller build.spec`.
You can then run the executable at `dist/roguelike_tutorial/roguelike_tutorial.exe`.

`PROJECT_NAME` is setup as a convenient way to set the project name.
This will affect the executable name and the distribution directory name.

`datas=[("data", "data")]` will copy all files from the data directory (first `"data"`) to the data directory of the distribution (second `"data"`.)

An `icon` is optional and that line can be deleted, otherwise `icon.ico` can be downloaded from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TStand90/tcod_tutorial_v2/fd2364dbf184ea83f571c96110dc35c5349ade1d/icon.ico) and put in the project directory.

This has been setup for all parts of the 2021 tutorial.
