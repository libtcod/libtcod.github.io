This site in a work in progress, for now, and possibly forever.

The old libtcod 1.6.4 docs are hosted [here](docs/index2.html?c=true&cpp=true).
This is not to be mistaken for the [python-tcod docs](https://python-tcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) or the [new libtcod docs](https://libtcod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

The 2021 Python tutorial is [here](tutorials/python/2021).

All other libtcod stuff can be found [here](https://github.com/libtcod).
